# **Project 3 - Credit risk modelling - A machine learning model**

Based on the dataset related to credit risk and contains information about individuals who have taken loans, I develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on various financial and demographic factors of the borrowers.

Please see the file '[**Project 3_credit_risk_modelling.ipynb**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_project2/blob/main/Project2.ipynb)' along with the '**credit_risk_dataset.csv**' datasets above.
